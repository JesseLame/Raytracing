# Raytracing

We implemented all the minimum requirements; shadows on the plane aren't working properly. 

The ray tracer can be controlled with WASD for forward, left, backward and right movement.
JL for rotating the camera left and right.
ZX to zoom in and out (change camera distance to plane)
NM to change the FOV.

We implemented a texture for all primitives, this means planes and speheres. 

Most of our code is based on the slides.
Our ray plane intersection we based on the following site:

For the ray sphere intersection we used:
